                        We were tasked with creating an interactive Google Doodle. Taking inspiration from doodles created by Google over the years, we decided to take it a step further and create an immersive, virtual reality experience celebrating the 50 years of VR.

                <div class="project-section-med section-paragraph">A Google Doodle is a temporary alteration of the logo on Google’s homepage. It is usually an art piece designed to celebrate a person, an event, etc. Some doodles have been paintings, illustrations, animations, or videos. Recently, Google has been creating interactive doodles such as games.

                    The first ever VR device was a sensorama, which was a big bulky machine that displayed wireframes. Currently, VR can be experiences using devices as small as a phone. Users can use it for anything ranging from immersive 3d models to full gameplay experiences.</div>

While we were asked to create a 2D Google Doodle, but we decided to create a 3D virtual reality experience in order to fully convey the meaning of virtual reality.

                    Virtual reality is one of the most innovative inventions of technology so far. It was only recently made accessible, VR has been around for a while! We decided to commemorate it’s 50th anniversary.</div>

                <div class="project-section-med section-paragraph">Our biggest obstacle: we didn’t know how to create virtual reality experiences. Through hours of research and mentoring from an upper year IXD student, we found A-Frame.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    A-Frame is a JavaScript framework that simplifies and minimizes the code needed to create virtual reality experiences for web-based programs. While my team got to work on modelling the 3d environment, I started to explore and learn the new framework and create some test environments.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    While I was slightly familiar with JavaScript, A-Frame was almost like learning a whole new language, and the biggest challenges was finding out how to integrate JavaScript into the new framework. It took me days and countless tries in order to make the environment interactive. I tried many different techniques, which, most of them, failed.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We performed our first user test after hitting our first milestone, which was importing the first draft of our 3d model with minor interactions. The first testers reported minor issues such as getting motion sick (due to the headset/immersive experience) and that some colours needed refinement, which we fixed in the second iteration.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Some users also reported accidentally teleporting because of the placement of the portals, and not knowing what to do in terms of interactivity. We fixed this by moving the portal a few units, as well as adding tool tips to help users understand the experience.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In the end, I couldn’t quite get the result I was hoping for due to it not being a function that is available or suitable for a mobile device. But I ended up recreating the effect in a simpler way without taking away the magic of VR.

                <h2 class="project-section-sm section-title text-mono">Final Product</h2>
                <div class="project-section-med section-paragraph">My biggest breakthrough: clickable objects. One of the interactions I wanted to add to the environment was clickable objects. I spent hours reading the documentation, doing researching, and experimenting in order to get it working the way I wanted it to. I was an amateur coder with little JavaScript experience and no A-Frame experience, so it was quite a challenge.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    After many experiments, I found that when objects are imported separately from the scene, they can be called on as objects in JavaScript. Add an event listener here, and an effect there, and we got clickable objects!
                    <h4 class="section-subheading text-mono-bold">Reflection</h4>
                    Before this project, I had minimal experience with JavaScript. I didn’t fully understand how it all worked. I learned how various parts of JavaScript work, as well as how to properly organize code in order to make my workflow more efficient.
