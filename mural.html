                        A 2-week research project where I lead the exploration of the capabilities of ARjs. The research will be used in the creation and development of an interactive transmedia mural to be installed at the Trafalgar Road campus of Sheridan College.

                <div class="project-section-med section-paragraph">This was a research/conceptual job, we were not required to come up with a final product or solution. We were tasked to explore the technology we were given and find it’s capabilities and limits.
                    <br><br>
                    We had a secondary objective of using multiple types of media to create interactivity for the mural. This included both physical and digital media. We decided to create an AR experience as well as a website for the digital experiences. We also decided to add capacitive touch and projection mapping to the mural as physical experiences.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This was a research project, so our process consisted of 2 weeks of exploration or iteration, with no final product in mind. We held two days of brainstorming sessions, and continuously ideated while we did exploration and research in the upcoming weeks.

                    <h4 class="section-subheading text-mono-bold">Understanding the User</h4>Our primary target audience for the mural are the students attending the Trafalgar campus of Sheridan College. We needed to create interactions with the behaviour of students in mind.
                    <br><br>
                    We decided to ask the following questions to define our user:
                    <br>
                    ¬ programs (mainly art)<br>
                    ¬ age range<br>
                    ¬ education<br>
                    ¬ family<br>
                    ¬ relationship status
                    <br><br>
                    We had to consider the following factors in ideation:
                    <br>
                    ¬ Aesthetic<br>
                    ¬ Contributions to community<br>

                <div class="project-section-med section-paragraph">The team consisted of 3 interaction designers, 4 illustration students, and 2 professors who supervised the project. I worked closely with the illustration students who created the content being used in the AR components of the project. Throughout the project, they were constantly sending experimental markers, illustrations, and videos. I would later use the content they provide to experiment what I could do with them in AR.
                    <br><br>
                    One of the big breakthroughs was using fully coloured markers (image and border) and embedding that into an illustration. One of the students also experimented with placing the illustration at a 45 degree angle, so that the marker was a diamond instead of a square. Doing so helped expand the creativity of the illustration students because they are no longer restrained to thick black borders.
                    <h4 class="section-subheading text-mono-bold">Challenges</h4>
                    There are rarely any documentation available for AR frameworks, so the biggest problem I encountered when I started this project was trying to understand what each line of code did. I tried to read as many articles about the code, and experimented with the available code to try to explore.

                <div class="project-section-med section-paragraph">After the two week sprint, I started to understand how the code works together in order to create AR experiences. I was able to get a clearer of idea of it's capabilities, and how we can push AR further to create deeper and more immersive experiences.
                    <br><br>
                    While working on the project, I decided to create a boilerplate which will make the code easier to use and learn. It has turned into a smaller side project (in collaboration with <a href="https://www.harrypunia.com" class="clickable" target="_blank">Harry Punia</a>), which can be found on my <a href="https://www.github.com/roneilla/AR-boilerplate" class="clickable" target="_blank">GitHub</a> (project is still a work in progress).
