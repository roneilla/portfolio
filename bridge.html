                    There is no doubt that entering a new environment is scary. This is especially true for post-secondary students entering school for the first time. They are leaving their home, what most of them have been familiar with since they were children. Some suffer from loneliness and depression from leaving home, and some have a hard time making close connections with those around them. Most post-secondary schools have a peer mentorship program, which is a form of mentorship between experienced students and new students (however, it is not limited to new students).

                    <h4 class="section-subheading text-mono-bold">Findings</h4>
                    A significant majority of students surveyed were concerned about making friends. I also found that students found more value in advice from experienced peers rather than academic staff.

                    Using divergent brainstorming and affinity mapping, I ideated features that would best help reach the goals. I sorted my ideas into 4 categories:<br>
                    ¬ Mentor and mentee matching<br>
                    ¬ Social connections<br>
                    ¬ Nurturing connections<br>

                    After ideating features for the app, I wanted to see where Bridge would tie in to a user's emotional journey, and the possible outcome from using the app. I created an emotional journey based on a possible scenario. Bridge serves as the point in which a person transitions from a stranger to a close friend to a student.

                    <br><br>
                    A detailed, research-based questionnaire will be used in order to create better matches for the users. There will also be events and groups pages to promote social interactions. Each mentor-mentee conversation will be given a prompt of the week to encourage regular interactions between users.
                    <br><br>
                    By improving social interactions, we are creating better connections between mentors and mentees.

                    The questionnaire and profile set up are both long forms, I added a progress bar to give the user information about their current status/stage on the forms.<br><br>
                    Instead of a long line, I used circles to differentiate between each main stage. The progress bar will fill up slowly until it gets to the next circle to signify finishing a stage.<br><br>
                    It will also start with the first ellipse filled in, users will be more motivated to finish if they know that they have already begun the process.
                    <h4 class="section-subheading text-mono-bold">Card Systems</h4>
                    <div id="bridge-gallery">
                        <img src="assets/img/bridge-final-3.jpg" alt="" class="img-ctn-med">

                            <img src="assets/img/bridge-final-5.jpg" alt="" class="img-ctn">
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    The 3 tabs (Mentors, Events, Groups) on the Discover page will be utilizing cards components. I experimented with different layouts to see which would work best for information hierarchy. I found that the card above works best because it clearly divides each piece of information: name, description, tags, and the buttons. The other cards didn’t work because some were imbalanced, didn’t have a good flow, or didn’t display information that were necessary.
                    <h4 class="section-subheading text-mono-bold">Tags</h4>
                    <img src="assets/img/bridge-final-6.jpg" alt="" class="img-ctn-med-ctr">
                    Mentors and mentees will both be asked the same questions for “Interests and Hobbies”. This will be an important part for the accuracy of matchmaking. There will be predetermined tags, but users will also be given a choice to add their own. This will give users more control with the tags they add to their profile. Adding more tags can will also ensure better matches. The green tags are clicked states and the grey tags are the unselected states.
                    <h4 class="section-subheading text-mono-bold">Mentor Results</h4>
                    <img src="assets/img/bridge-final-7.jpg" alt="" class="img-ctn-med-ctr">
                    After the mentee completes the questionnaire, they will have access to all the top-level pages. The first page after the form will be the Discover Mentors page. It is going to be a list of recommended mentors for matches, according to their answers.<br><br>
                    The card will reveal the name and the headline of the mentor. The three tags shown will be the specialties they can help the mentee with. The tags displayed will be according to the questions. Users are given a large, high contrast button for sending requests. They are also given an option to delete, to give them more control over their feed.
                    <h4 class="section-subheading text-mono-bold">Events + Groups</h4>
                    <img src="assets/img/bridge-final-8.jpg" alt="" class="img-ctn-med-ctr">
                    The other tabs will be Events and Groups. One of the categories that students feel they were not successful in were taking part in campus events. By adding an events page, the app can help promote events that are suitable for the student’s interests. There will also be a groups tab, which will be groups created by students. It will also be recommended based on the student’s interests. Both tabs will also use the same card layout as the recommended mentors page in order to keep the consistency.
                    <h4 class="section-subheading text-mono-bold">Prompt of the Week</h4>
                    <img src="assets/img/bridge-final-9.jpg" alt="" class="img-ctn-med-ctr">
                    Once a mentor and mentee has matched, they will be able to communicate to each other through the platform. To encourage regular communication, there will be a prompt of the week provided every week. Each prompt will be a question or a phrase that will help the students get to know each other and build a stronger connection.

                    <h4 class="section-subheading text-mono-bold">Growth Areas</h4>
                    In the future, I'd like to redesign some aspects of the app. I would like to create personas, map out user scenarios and more flows, and conduct user testing and further research in order to make sure that the app succeeds in its goals, which are to fulfill the users' needs of building a bridge of connection with their peers.
                    <br><br>
                    I am currently working on updating the project. Since my initial completion, I've created an emotional journey and new development is in progress (such as personas and scenarios).

                    <h4 class="section-subheading text-mono-bold">Key Takeaways</h4>
                    One thing I learned from this project is the importance of process and research. This was a lengthy and loaded project I carried out throughout the week. Being a design challenge, I focused mostly on my process instead of perfecting the design. I focused on user flows and journeys to make sure that the user is one step closer to their goal.
                    <br><br>
                    I also learned the importance of understooding the user experience. I drew from research and personal experience in order to build an experience that I knew I would love to have had access to when I was in first year. Putting myself in users shoes help form the narrative in my head &mdash; which in turn, helped me form the solution.
                    <br><br>
                    It's easy to get stuck on in endless brainstorm and ideation process, but because I only had a finite amount of time, I had to choose a solution quick. Instead of constantly brainstorming until the perfect idea, I set aside a time of 3 hours total for the first stage (brainstorm/ideation). This stage included research. I felt that it was better to choose a good idea to iterate and improve than to wait days to come up with the "perfect" or a "better" idea.
