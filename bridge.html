                    The goal of peer mentorship programs are to improve student retention rates.

                    </h4>

                    ¬ Give mentee a sense of belonging<br>
                    ¬ Provide support to students, especially those who are entering post-secondary for the first time<br>
                    ¬ Targets minority groups who might feel less connected to the community

                    </h4>
                    The 3 categories with the lowest success rates are:
                    <br>
                    ¬ Getting involved with campus activities (50%)<br>
                    ¬ Finding career info (69%)<br>
                    ¬ Making friends (73%) and getting academic advice (73%)
                    <br><br>
                    A significant majority of students surveyed were concerned about making friends. I also found that students found more value in advice from experienced peers rather than academic staff

                    <h4 class="section-subheading text-mono-bold">Goals</h4>
                    The success of the solution will be measured using 2 goals:<br>
                    1. Ensure that pairings made are a good match.<br>
                    2. Promote regular meetings or conversations.

                    Using divergent brainstorming and affinity mapping, I ideated features that would best help reach the goals. I sorted my ideas into 4 categories:<br>
                    ¬ Mentor and mentee matching<br>
                    ¬ Social connections<br>
                    ¬ Nurturing connections<br>

                    <br><br>
                    It utilizes questionnaires, information hierarchy, and messaging to improve social interactions between mentors and mentees.
                    <br><br>
                    A detailed, research-based questionnaire will be used in order to create better matches for the users. There will also be events and groups pages to promote social interactions. Each mentor-mentee conversation will be given a prompt of the week to encourage regular interactions between users.
                    <br><br>
                    By improving social interactions, we are creating better connections between mentors and mentees.

                    <img src="assets/img/bridge-final-2.jpg" alt="" class="img-ctn-med-ctr">
                    The questionnaire and profile set up are both long forms, I added a progress bar to give the user information about their current status/stage on the forms.<br><br>
                    Instead of a long line, I used circles to differentiate between each main stage. The progress bar will fill up slowly until it gets to the next circle to signify finishing a stage.<br><br>
                    It will also start with the first ellipse filled in, users will be more motivated to finish if they know that they have already begun the process.
                    <h4 class="section-subheading text-mono-bold">Card Systems</h4>
                    <div id="bridge-gallery">

                        </div>
                    </div>
                    The 3 tabs (Mentors, Events, Groups) on the Discover page will be utilizing cards components. I experimented with different layouts to see which would work best for information hierarchy.<br><br>
                    I found that the card below (1.1) works best because it clearly divides each piece of information: name, description, tags, and the buttons.<br><br>
                    The other cards didn’t work because some were imbalanced, didn’t have a good flow, or didn’t display information that were necessary.
                    <h4 class="section-subheading text-mono-bold">Tags</h4>
                    <img src="assets/img/bridge-final-6.jpg" alt="" class="img-ctn-med-ctr">
                    Mentors and mentees will both be asked the same questions for “Interests and Hobbies”. This will be an important part for the accuracy of matchmaking.<br><br>
                    There will be predetermined tags, but users will also be given a choice to add their own. This will give users more control with the tags they add to their profile. Adding more tags can will also ensure better matches.<br><br>
                    The green tags are clicked states and the grey tags are the unselected states.
                    <h4 class="section-subheading text-mono-bold">Mentor Results</h4>
                    <img src="assets/img/bridge-final-7.jpg" alt="" class="img-ctn-med-ctr">
                    After the mentee completes the questionnaire, they will have access to all the top-level pages. The first page after the form will be the Discover Mentors page. It is going to be a list of recommended mentors for matches, according to their answers.<br><br>
                    The card will reveal the name and the headline of the mentor. The three tags shown will be the specialties they can help the mentee with. The tags displayed will be according to the questions.<br><br>
                    Users are given a large, high contrast button for sending requests. They are also given an option to delete, to give them more control over their feed.
                    <h4 class="section-subheading text-mono-bold">Events + Groups</h4>
                    <img src="assets/img/bridge-final-8.jpg" alt="" class="img-ctn-med-ctr">
                    The other tabs will be Events and Groups. One of the categories that students feel they were not successful in were taking part in campus events. By adding an events page, the app can help promote events that are suitable for the student’s interests.<br><br>
                    There will also be a groups tab, which will be groups created by students. It will also be recommended based on the student’s interests.<br><br>
                    Both tabs will also use the same card layout as the recommended mentors page in order to keep the consistency.
                    <h4 class="section-subheading text-mono-bold">Prompt of the Week</h4>
                    <img src="assets/img/bridge-final-9.jpg" alt="" class="img-ctn-med-ctr">
                    Once a mentor and mentee has matched, they will be able to communicate to each other through the platform. To encourage regular communication, there will be a prompt of the week provided every week.<br><br>
                    Each prompt will be a question or a phrase that will help the students get to know each other and build a stronger connection.
