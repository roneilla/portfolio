            The team consisted of 3 interaction designers, 4 illustration students, and 2 professors who supervised the project. I worked closely with the illustration students who created the content being used in the AR components of the project.
            <br>
            <br>
            Throughout the project, they were constantly sending experimental markers, illustrations, and videos. I would later use the content they provide to experiment what I could do with them in AR.
            <br>
            <br>
            One of the big breakthroughs were using fully coloured markers (image and border) and embedding that into an illustration. One of the students also experimented with placing the illustration at a 45 degree angle, so that the marker was a diamond instead of a square. Doing so helped expand the creativity of the illustration students because they are no longer restrained to thick black borders.

        <div class="p2 work-description">
            There are rarely any documentation available for AR frameworks, so the biggest problem I encountered when I started this project was trying to understand what each line of code did. I tried to read as many articles about the code, and experimented with the available code to try to explore.

        <div class="header2 work-title">Results</div>
        <div class="p2 work-description">
            After the two week sprint, I started to understand how the code works together in order to create AR experiences. I was able to get a clearer of idea of it's capabilities, and how we can push AR further to create deeper and more immersive experiences.
            <br>
            <br>
            While working on the project, I decided to create a boilerplate which will make the code easier to use and learn. It has turned into a smaller side project (in collaboration with Harry Punia), which can be found on my GitHub (project is still a work in progress).
            <br>
            <br>
            Since the internship, I have been experimenting with more AR capabilities. The results can be found in the Lab page, or click here.
